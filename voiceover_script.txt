Hello, judges. This presentation introduces GreenLift AI, an innovative, intelligent VTOL drone delivery ecosystem designed specifically for Small and Medium Enterprises, or SMEs, in Bangladesh. This solution represents a significant leap towards sustainable, efficient, and AI-driven logistics. The team combines diverse expertise in software engineering, technical innovation, research, and presentation. Meet our team: Parvez, our tech lead and systems expert; Arman, our technical innovator and collaborator; Lamia, our presentation and research specialist; and Basim, our AI and research lead. Together, we're uniquely positioned to develop and execute this solution. The foundation of GreenLift AI lies in understanding a significant problem. SMEs in Bangladesh face immense challenges with traditional logistics. Our solution addresses critical challenges faced by SMEs. 89% struggle with inefficient last-mile delivery, 91% face delays during monsoons, and delivery costs eat up 18-25% of their budgets. Furthermore, traditional logistics significantly contribute to carbon emissions. These problems limit growth and profitability for countless businesses. GreenLift AI directly tackles these issues with a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective solution. GreenLift AI integrates solar-powered VTOL drones with an AI-driven business intelligence platform. Our drones take off vertically, transition to efficient horizontal flight, and deliver packages precisely. The system features fleet of solar-powered VTOL,flight for long distances, smart tension sensors for safety.This design ensures access to even remote areas and operates effectively during adverse weather conditions. The system is designed for zero-carbon emissions, powered entirely by solar energy. The second pillar of our solution is the integrated AI dashboard.Crucially, our AI analyzes delivery patterns, demand, and inventory, providing SMEs with actionable insights. Technically, our solution leverages advanced technologies. The AI components are built using Python, TensorFlow, and other machine learning libraries. The web platform utilizes FastAPI for robust backend services. The drone control system employs ROS for robotics integration. Security and user authentication are handled using industry-standard protocols, ensuring reliable and secure operations. Let's see our prototype in action.Our prototype demonstrates the core functionality of GreenLift AI. The simulation visualizes the drone's journey. It begins with a takeoff from the designated hub, simulating the vertical lift-off capability. The drone then transitions to horizontal flight, navigating efficiently towards the delivery destination. During the flight, the system continuously monitors solar power levels, battery status, and server connectivity, all critical for safe and successful delivery. Upon arrival, the drone descends and safely releases the package using a controlled string mechanism. The system includes a crucial safety feature: if the package weight exceeds the predetermined safe limit, the drone automatically releases the load to prevent accidents, demonstrating our commitment to safety. The AI analytics section provides deeper insights. It visualizes potential cost savings, predicted revenue growth for SMEs, and operational efficiency metrics. The system also offers inventory intelligence, using predictive models to suggest optimal stock levels, helping SMEs manage their resources better. What sets GreenLift AI apart? Our solution is the first to combine zero-carbon drone delivery with sophisticated business intelligence specifically tailored for the Bangladeshi SME market. We offer a one-time setup cost model, eliminating the recurring expenses associated with traditional delivery wages. Our AI integration goes beyond simple logistics, providing actionable business insights that enhance the user experience and solve problems more effectively than existing solutions. The combination of environmental sustainability, cost efficiency, and intelligent analytics creates a unique value proposition for SMEs. The market opportunity for GreenLift AI is substantial. Bangladesh is home to over 10.4 million SMEs, forming the backbone of the economy. A significant 78% of these operate in areas with poor existing logistics infrastructure. This represents a vast, underserved market demanding efficient, reliable, and cost-effective delivery solutions. Our primary target users include pharmaceutical distributors, food and grocery retailers, e-commerce platforms, and agricultural suppliers. The potential market size for logistics in Bangladesh is valued at over 10 billion US dollars, presenting a significant opportunity for growth and impact. Looking ahead, our development plan is clear. The immediate next steps involve completing the physical prototype, focusing on refining the VTOL mechanisms and payload handling. Following this, we will seek regulatory approval from the Bangladesh Civil Aviation Authority, a crucial step for commercial operation. We plan to launch a pilot program with selected SME partners in the Pabna district to validate our solution in a real-world environment. Based on the pilot's success, we will scale operations, initially covering northern Bangladesh and eventually expanding nationwide within 24 months. Our goal is to build a scalable, green logistics network that transforms last-mile delivery for SMEs across South Asia. We believe GreenLift AI will revolutionize SME logistics.
