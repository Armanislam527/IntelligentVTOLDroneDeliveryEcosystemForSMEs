my consern is to simulate the drone delivery direct on map i want to simulate the drone to fly over the real map from one place to another place and the route of the drone will be marked on the map. start and destination will also indicated.the drone simulation can be over my university Pabna University of Science and Technology or around pabna or in another place like jashore city in bangladesh and the simulation can be over on 1 km of distance. you can use the svg model or also can use a js library to simulate it without svg. i need a ultrarealistic simulation.if possible then simulate it 3d on a real map.do the simulation in Full 3D Scene CesiumJS / Three.js + terrain True 3D flight with altitude + lighting Heavy but beautiful (ideal for hackathon video) and my campuse exact location is:[24.013306177900954, 89.27968061757348] use openstreetmaps api so that no need to put api token lets design it.i want the drone path to be a delivery route (takeoff → drop → return).use proper z index for the drone so that i can be visible clearly. implement this by just raw html and css .
